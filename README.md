j(m)scroll : Infinite Scrolling Plugin for jQuery / jQuery Mobile

A Variation Of Philip Klauzinski's excellent jscroll Plugin (<a href="http://jscroll.com">http://jscroll.com</a>). The only problem i had with it was that when jQuery Mobile was included jscroll was loading more than one page at initialization. Given that, and my need for a not fixed footer for social buttons, copyrights et al. i created a simpler version that loads more content when user scrolls to the starting of the footer (or some predefined pxs above it). I would really like to know what breaks jscroll when jQuery Mobile is included. If you know the answer please share it with me. Unfortunately i don't have the time to find it myself.
